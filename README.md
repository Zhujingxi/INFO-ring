# **INFO-RING**

**A ring that can store you memory.**

## Description

This project is intended to store your memory in a ring. 

## About algorithms

It’s worth noting that this algorithm is just a simple example to demonstrate the idea and it won’t be the final version. In future versions, I will try to implement more complex algorithms to increase information density and endurance.

## Q&A

1. Why use HASH?

* Due to the ability of a hash to represent a complex file with a simple string, it is an effective way to reduce file size and make it possible to record information in a small area. Although there is a 100% chance of hash collisions occurring when implementing larger files, recording the file size in the model can substantially reduce the number of collisions. Additionally, we know that the files we store have some meaning, such as a video, photo or text. By adding this as a condition, I would say it is impossible for collisions to disturb the original information.
